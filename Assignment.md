## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

- **Branching:**  
  Helped me develop features in isolation without interfering with the main site. I was able to test designs separately before merging.

- **Pull Requests:**  
  Pull requests allowed me to submit features in an organized way. It was easy to track what was being added and to collaborate or review changes.

- **Structured Commits:**  
  Using commit types like `feat`, `fix`, and `docs` made it easier to understand the history of my project. It also made my commits more professional.

- **Project Boards:**  
  The GitHub Project Board helped me break down the site into tasks like layout, styling, and content. This gave structure to my development process and kept me focused.
